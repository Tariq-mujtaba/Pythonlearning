# Number Explorer Interactive Tool

This Python program is an interactive tool designed for users who love exploring numbers. The program prompts users to input their name and three of their favorite numbers. Based on these inputs, it performs several fun and informative calculations, such as determining whether the numbers are even or odd, calculating their squares, summing them up, and checking if the sum is a prime number.

## Features

   - It responds with a personalized greeting using the userâ€™s name.

2. **Even or Odd Check:**

   - The program checks each of the user's favorite numbers and identifies whether they are even or odd.
   - This information is stored in a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the number and its "even" or "odd" status.

3. **Square Calculation:**

   - The program calculates the square of each number.
   - These squared values are stored in another list of tuples and printed in a friendly format.
